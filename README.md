Requires Material Design Icon Font from: https://materialdesignicons.com/

Copy TrueType font (ttf) to /usr/share/fonts/truetype/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf

Also, requires a ttf font, Arial in the code - but can be modified to whatever fonts you like / have.

To be fully lazy, you can use:

sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer

That will put Arial in the place the code looks for it.
